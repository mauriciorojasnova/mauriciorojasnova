### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”Ž Solving problems is one of the most atractives activities, or at least that's what I think. That reason was my motivation to become a mechanical engineer.

ðŸš€ My fascination for finding solutions led me to work with research groups in R+D+i projects in the aeroespace sector.

ðŸ’» After finishing my degree, I realized that the world was full of data that needs to be understood and shared. So I decided to become more involved in tech sector with [Platzi](https://platzi.com/).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about web development and data science.
